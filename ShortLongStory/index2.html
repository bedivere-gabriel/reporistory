                <h1>A Short Long Story</h1>
                <h4>Written by J.G.Pagtalunan</h4>
                <p class="text-justify">On a windy summer afternoon, Max takes his dog Dodger for a walk. They follow this routine every weekend. But when Max got fired from his last job, he took Dodger for a walk everyday. Though it sounds depressing in Max's perspective, you'd never see him with a long face. He keeps his chin up masking the loneliness and problems he buried deep. Max lives alone in an old not-so-fancy apartment Downtown. It's all he can afford after all. He told himself as long as he has Dodger who he treats more of a family rather than just a companion, he would be alright.  As they were walking just outside their apartment building, Dodger caught the attention of a squirrel across the main road. Dodger was so furious and really wanted to jump onto that squirrel. Max spends too much time on his last job, he figured that he had never taken the time to train Dodger. He took his unemployment as a positive thing, he thought that now he has more time with him, he can train him everyday while he waits for a new job opening. Dodger is a 6 year old male German Shepherd, he is quite strong from an average dog. Dodger was pulling on his leash too hard and it started slipping from Max's hand. Max wrapped the leash on his arm and kept pulling Dodger while calling his attention, but Dodger just wont stop till he had that squirrel. Then the leash slipped from his arm! Dodger went berserk and ran. As Dodger ran through the road, Max saw a massive cargo truck that was about to hit him. He shouted at the driver, but the windshield was up and he couldn't hear him. Max doesn't have the time to react nor to respond. And it was already too late for him to jump onto Dodger and save him. His heartbeat raised and a cold wind blew that made him shiver down his spine and in that moment he remembered everything with Dodger, the first time he saw him when he adopted him as a little puppy in the shelter, every night he struggled sleeping because Dodger was barking all night long, the mess that Dodger made every time Max came home from work while Dodger had this proud look on his face. He remembered it all and he can't imagine that this would be his last walk with him. He shut his eyes out of fear, and tears started falling. And for a moment, he could hear nothing. The silence urged Max open to his eyes. And then he saw a blonde lady carrying Dodger while walking towards him. Max quickly wiped his face off of tears and ran towards the lady with worry and excitement. The lady scolded him, told him to keep an eye on him next time and gave him advice on handling his dog. He was speechless. He felt small as if a kid listening to an elderly giving life advice. Max could not hear anything she was saying, he was just so happy and relieved that Dodger was okay. Then Max noticed this lady has shallow scars on her knees. He figured that she got it when she jumped in front of the truck while trying to save Dodger from getting hit. She was also with a dog herself, too. He immediately asked her permission to treat her scars and that if she wanted to walk with him with their dogs after. It stopped her from nagging and was surprised that she did not notice she had scarred herself. She agreed to walk with but only to continue nagging about his irresponsibility. Hers was a beagle named Samantha. He later found out the lady's name was Alex. Then they got very close ever since. Two years have passed and their relationship has grown stronger. He asked Alex if she wanted to move into his apartment, and she did a few days later. Dodger and Samantha got along pretty well, they were both happy. Max and Alex never had any real issues, sometimes Max wondered that if this was all a dream then he wished to never wake-up. Max still can't find a job though, but Alex didn't mind that, she supports Max and persuades him to follow his passion in animation. On a winter midnight, an incoming phone call woke Max and Alex up from their sleep. Max answered the call. He was lost and didn't know what to say after hearing the words from the other end. He began thanking the guy on the phone so much, and Alex smiled and asked him who was on the phone. Max replied that it was Danny from the Disney Pictures. They saw his portfolio and they invited him for an interview tomorrow morning. They both jumped in joy, screaming from the top of their lungs, celebrating. But it was very late, though, so they both went back to bed. Max cuddled Alex while on the bed so tight as if it was the last time. Alex said "Now you almost got your life back together love." Max overflowing with joy, failed to process what Alex meant by that. He closed his eyes and kissed her till they both fell asleep. On the next day Max woke up at 8 in the morning but Alex wasn't on the bed nor the bathroom. He figured that she might be on her way to her work already and because it was already late, too. But he felt sad because she didn't kiss him goodbye. Max took a bath and dressed up for the incoming interview later and took a heavy breakfast. Funny that Dodger and Samantha were nowhere to be found inside the apartment. He thought that maybe Alex already entrusted both of them to their neighbor since no one would be left in the apartment today. Max ignites his car engine and maneuvers out of the parking space. He glanced over his watch and noticed that there was only half an hour left before his interview started. The Disney Pictures' office was an hour away from his apartment. Max stepped on the gas, and drove recklessly going on a 90 on a two lane road. As he was approaching the intersection he already saw that the stoplight was on yellow, but he thought that he would still make it across. So Max went on fifth gear and stepped on it. Max failed to see an SUV intersecting the road and that it was already in red light. The SUV T-boned his car and sent it rolling for a few meters. He lost consciousness and later woke up in a hospital bed. The nurse taking care of him ran outside his room and called Doctor. The Doctor came into the room and asked how he was feeling. Max asked what happened, and the Doctor told the story. The Doctor had a distressed look on his face and Max noticed it. Max asked if something bad happened to his internals. The Doctor said that nothing bad really happened to him, the belt-buckle and the airbag from his car saved him from taking any serious injuries. "But while you were asleep we ran a CT scan. And we noticed there was already an anomaly in your brain even before the accident. It seems that you have an Acoustic Neuroma, a type of brain tumor that is hard to diagnose early on. But let's not panic, we're not entirely sure what it is exactly yet and maybe you could help us". Max swallowed and replied "how can I help exactly?". The Doctor asked if he was experiencing any hallucinations or any psychotic manifestations. "Absolutely not! No." Max replied. "While in your sleep we heard you say the name Alex" the Doctor said "who is she to you?" he asked. "She's my fiancé." Max said. "Can you call her right now and tell her I'm alright?" the Doctor gave Max's phone to him and nodded.  Max opened his phone and quickly went to contacts. He could not find the name Alex nor any call signs they were using. "What did you do to my phone!?" Max shouted. "We didn't do anything to it Max'' the Doctor replied calmly. "Why can't I find her cell number here!". "What does this Alex look like Max?" the Doctor asked. Max seemed bewitched that he can't even remember what his fiancé looked like. He pulled up his phone again and opened the gallery hoping to see her fiancé's face. All it has is a photo of a dog from two years ago. Suddenly, unknowingly, tears started falling from Max's eyes while he stared on the picture of the dog. He then immediately requested to be checked out of the Hospital. The Doctor gave him an advice though, that he should come back and take another MRI. Max disregarded everything the Doctor said and was left staring into the void. He took a bus back to his apartment and everything seemed to clear up as seconds passed by. He opened his apartment door and saw a picture of a dog and a dog tag with the name "Dodger" on the coffee table. He sat on the couch and he grabbed the dog tag and he held it very tight, then he lifted the picture of Dodger and held it close to him. His face covered in tears. He wanted to scream but he couldn't. He remembers everything now. He knew he had been lying to himself. He couldn't bear the truth that he refused to accept what happened. That day that the accident didn't happen two years ago, did happen. And there was no one there that saved Dodger from his fate.</p>
