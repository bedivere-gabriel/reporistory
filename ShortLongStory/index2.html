                <h1>A Short Long Story</h1>
                <h4>Written by J.G.Pagtalunan</h4>
                <p class="text-justify">(March of 2014) On a windy summer afternoon, Max takes a walk with his dog, Dodger. They do this routine every weekend whenever Max’s day-off. When Max got fired from his job as a web designer, he took this opportunity to take Dodger for a walk every day in the afternoon. Though it sounds upsetting in Max's standpoint, you'd never see him with a long face. He kept his chin up masking away the problems that he buried deep inside, instead of facing them. Max lives alone in an old plain apartment Downtown. This is just what he can afford, and even now, three weeks of unemployment, he struggles to pay his bills.  He told himself as long as Dodger who he treats more of a family rather than just a companion, stood beside him, he would be all right.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="text-justify">As they were walking just outside their apartment building, Dodger’s attention was caught by a squirrel across the main road. He quickly turned into a vicious dog and was eager to jump onto that squirrel.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="text-justify">Max spent too much time on his last job, he figured that he had never taken the time to train him, he can’t even sit on command. He took this unemployment as a positive thing, he thought that now he has more time with him, he can train him every day while he finds for a job opening. Dodger is an 8-year-old German Shepherd, he is quite strong from an average dog because Max fed him not with synthetic dog food that can be bought in any pet shop, he fed him with real food that humans also eat. He sometimes shared his dinner with him.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="text-justify">Few minutes of struggling, Dodger won’t stop from pulling on his leash. It started slipping from Max's hand. Max immediately wrapped the leash on his arm and kept pulling Dodger while trying to call his attention, but Dodger just won’t stop till he had that squirrel. His teeth showing, his claws scratching the pavement. Then the leash snapped! Dodger went berserk and ran. As Dodger was running across the road, Max saw a massive speeding cargo truck that’s just a few feet away from Dodger. It gave him chills, and he swallowed. He tried shouting at the driver, but the windshield was up and he was unable to hear him.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="text-justify">Max doesn't have enough time to respond. And it was already too late for him to jump in front of the truck to try and save his dog. His heartbeat seemed to stop for a moment and a cold wind blew that made him shiver down his spine and at that moment, his life with Dodger flashed before his very eyes. The first time he saw him when he adopted him as a pup from the shelter, all the nights he struggled to sleep because Dodger was barking all night long, the mess that Dodger made every time Max came home from work while Dodger had this proud look on his face. He remembered it all. He could not believe it, he could not imagine that this would be his last walk with him, he can’t take it. He shut his eyes out of fear, and tears started falling. And for a moment, everything was black and he could hear nothing.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="text-justify">The silence urged Max open to his eyes. Then he saw a blonde petite with a pearl-like skin carrying Dodger while walking towards him. Max ran towards the lady, his face drowning with tears. The moment he got to her the lady shouted at him, she told him to be responsible next time. He was speechless. He felt a sense of relief. She nagged onto him over and over again, as if he felt like little kid listening to an elderly scolding a youngling. Max could barely understand anything she’s saying, he was just so happy that Dodger was all right. Then Max noticed that this lady has shallow scars on her knees.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="text-justify">He figured that she got it when she jumped in front of the truck while trying to save his dog from getting hit. He noticed that behind her, she was holding a leash. She was with a dog herself too. He disregarded everything she’s saying and immediately asked her permission to escort her to the local clinic and asked if she wanted to walk with him with their dogs after just to repay his debt. It stopped her from talking and was shocked that she didn’t notice that she was bleeding. She agreed to walk with him but only to continue nagging about his irresponsibility.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="text-justify">While walking Max found out that her dog was a pure Shih Tzu named Samantha. He later found out her name was Alex. While on their way to the clinic, Max tried to make conversation, he asked what she does for a living. Alex seemed upset, she didn’t answer him. Max told her what he used to do. He also mentioned that he got fired from his last job because the company’s stocks were plummeting and in need to lessen the workforce. After her scars were treated in the clinic. Max asked “Maybe we could do this again tomorrow, walk our dogs? It’s Sunday, I mean if you don’t have anything to do. Maybe...” Alex didn't let him finish, she said sarcastically “Sure, so I can keep an eye on Dodger, you irresponsible person.” Max laughed, then they both went on their way home.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="text-justify">(October of 2016) Two years have passed and their relationship has grown stronger. Weeks before, Max proposed to Alex, she moved to his apartment a few days later. Dodger and Samantha got along pretty well, they were both bursting with joy. Running around, making a mess. Max and Alex never had any real issues, sometimes Max wondered that his life was too perfect even with the ups and downs, he thought that if this was all a dream, he wishes to never wake-up. Max still can't find a decent job, he earned cash from working freelance, but it is not stable. Sometimes Alex has to pay for their bills. But Alex didn't mind that, she supports Max and persuades him to follow his passion for animation.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="text-justify">(December of 2016) On winter midnight, a phone call woke Max and Alex up. Max stood up and answered the call. His jaw dropped, his throat cleared, his eyes staring into the void as he hears those words from the other end. He paused for a moment, he did not know what to say.<p>
                <br>
                <p class="text-justify">He began by thanking the guy on the phone so much and hanged-up. Alex got a little excited and curious, she smiled and asked him who it was. Max replied that it was Danny from Disney Pictures. They saw his portfolio and they invited him for an interview tomorrow morning. They both jumped in joy, screaming from the top of their lungs, celebrating. But it was very late, their dogs barked, as if like they’re annoyed that their sleep was disrupted from their screaming, so Max and Alex went back to bed. Max cuddled Alex while on the bed so tight as if it was the last time. Alex whispered to him, "Now you almost got your life back together love." Max overflowing with joy, failed to process what Alex meant by that. Alex was staring at him, proudly smiling. Max just closed his eyes and kissed her until he fell asleep</p>
                <br>
                <p class="text-justify">On the next day, He woke up at 8 in the morning but Alex wasn't on the bed nor the bathroom. He figured that she might be on her way to work already because it was already late too. But he felt sad because she didn't kiss him goodbye. He took a bath and dressed up for the incoming interview later and took a heavy breakfast. Funny that Dodger and Samantha were nowhere to be found inside the apartment. He thought that maybe Alex already entrusted both of them to their neighbor since no one would be left in the apartment to take care of them. He left his apartment and went to the parking lot. He ignites his car engine and maneuvers out of the parking space.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="text-justify">He hasn't driven on weekdays in a rush-hour for two years. He forgot how congested the traffic was going to work. He should have left the apartment earlier. He glanced over his watch and noticed that there was only half an hour left before his interview. The Disney Pictures' office was an hour away from his current location. Max stepped on the gas and drove recklessly going on a 90 on a two-lane road. As he was approaching the intersection he already saw that the stoplight was on yellow, but he thought that he would still make it across. So Max went on fifth gear and stepped on it even more. Max failed to see an SUV intersecting the road and that the light had turned red. The SUV T-boned his car and sent it rolling for a few meters. He could just hear sirens in the distance before passing out.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="text-justify">Unaware of the time, he woke up on a hospital bed. The nurse taking care of him saw his eyes twitched so she ran outside his room and called the doctor. The doctor came into the room and asked how he was feeling. Max asked what happened, and the doctor explained. The doctor had a distressed look on his face and Max noticed it. Max asked if something bad happened to his internals. The doctor said that nothing bad really happened to him, the belt-buckle and the airbag from his car saved him from taking any serious injuries. "But while you were asleep we ran a CT scan. And we noticed there was already an anomaly in your brain even before the accident. It seems that you have an Acoustic Neuroma, a type of brain tumor that is hard to diagnose early on. But let's not panic, we're not entirely sure if it is that exactly, so maybe you could help us". Max swallowed and replied, "how can I help exactly?". The doctor asked if he was experiencing any hallucinations or any psychotic manifestations. "Absolutely not! No." Max replied. "While in your sleep we heard you say the name Alex," the doctor said "who is she to you?" he asked. "She's my fiancé," Max said. "Can you call her right now and tell her I'm alright?" the doctor gave Max's phone to him and nodded. Max opened his phone and quickly went through contacts. He could not find the name Alex nor any call signs they were using. "Did my phone reset due to the crash?" Max shouted. "It seems that it didn’t, because the wallpaper is not the default, and we didn't do anything to it Max'' the Doctor replied calmly. "Why can't I find her cell number here!".
                </p>
                <br>
                <p class="text-justify">"What does this Alex look like Max?" the Doctor asked. Max seemed bewitched that he can hardly remember what his fiancé looked like. He pulled up his phone again and opened the gallery hoping to see her fiancé's face. All it has is a photo of a dog two years ago. Suddenly, unaware, tears started falling from Max's eyes while he stared at the picture of this dog. He immediately requested to be checked out of the Hospital and never spoke a word. The doctor advised him though, that he should come back and take another MRI. Max disregarded everything the doctor said and was left staring into the void.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p class="text-justify">He took a bus back to his apartment and everything seemed to clear up as seconds passed by. He opened his apartment door and saw a picture of a dog and a dog tag with the name "Dodger" on the coffee table. He sat on the couch and he grabbed the dog tag and he held it firmly, then he lifted the picture of the dog and pulled it close to him. His face covering up in tears as he looked at the picture. He wanted to scream but it felt like he had no voice. He remembers everything now. He knew he had been lying to himself. He couldn't bear the truth. He refused to accept what happened so his mind saved him from despair and misery. That day that the accident didn't happen two years ago, did happen. And there was no one there that saved Dodger from his fate.</p>
