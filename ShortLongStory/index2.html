                <h1>A Short Long Story</h1>
                <h4>Written by J.G.Pagtalunan</h4>
                <p class="text-justify">On a windy summer afternoon, Max takes his dog Dodger for a walk. They follow this routine every weekend. But when Max got fired from his last job, he took Dodger for a walk everyday. Though it sounds depressing in Max's perspective, you'd never see him with a long face. He keeps his chin up masking the loneliness and problems he buried deep. Max lives alone in an old not-so-fancy apartment Downtown. It's all he can afford after all. He told himself as long as he has Dodger who he treats more of a family rather than just a companion, he would be alright.  As they were walking just outside their apartment building, Dodger caught the attention of a squirrel across the main road. Dodger turned into a vicious dog and was eager to jump onto that squirrel.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="text-justify">Max spends too much time on his last job, he figured that he had never taken the time to train Dodger. He took his unemployment as a positive thing, he thought that now he has more time with him, he can train him everyday while he waits for a new job opening. Dodger is a 7 year old German Shepherd, he is quite strong from an average dog. </p>
                <br>
                <p class="text-justify">Dodger was pulling on his leash too hard and it started slipping from Max's hand. Max wrapped the leash on his arm and kept pulling Dodger while calling his attention, but Dodger just wont stop till he had that squirrel. Then the leash slipped from his arm! Dodger went berserk and ran. As Dodger ran across the road, Max saw a massive speeding cargo truck that’s just a few feet from Dodger. He tried shouting at the driver, but the windshield was up and unable to hear him. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p class="text-justify">Max doesn't have the time to react nor to respond. And it was already too late for him to jump onto Dodger and save him. His heartbeat raised and a cold wind blew that made him shiver down his spine and in that moment his life with him flashed before his eyes, the first time he saw him when he adopted him as a small puppy from the shelter, all the nights he struggled sleeping because Dodger was barking all night long, the mess that Dodger made every time Max came home from work while Dodger had this proud look on his face. He remembered it all. He can’t believe it, he could not imagine that this would be his last walk with him, he knew he can’t take it. He shut his eyes out of fear, and tears started falling. And for a moment, he could hear nothing. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p class="text-justify">The silence urged Max open to his eyes. Then he saw a blonde petite with a pearl-like skin carrying Dodger’s body while walking towards him. Max ran towards the lady, his face drowning in tears. The moment he got to her the lady shouted at him, told him to be a responsible friend next time. He was speechless. He felt a sense of relief. He nagged onto him over and over again. He felt small as if a kid listening to an elderly giving life advice. Max could barely understand what she’s saying, he was just so happy that Dodger was all right. Then Max noticed this lady has shallow scars on her knees. </p>
                <br>
                <p class="text-justify">He figured that she got it when she jumped in front of the truck while trying to save Dodger from getting hit. He noticed that behind her, she was holding a leash. She was with a dog herself, too. He immediately asked her permission to escort her to the local clinic and asked if she wanted to walk with him with their dogs after. It stopped her from nagging and was surprised that she didn’t notice that she was bleeding. She agreed to walk with him but only to continue nagging about his irresponsibility. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p class="text-justify">Hers was a Shih Tzu named Samantha. He later found out her name was Alex. While on their way to the clinic, Max asked what she does for a living. Alex seemed upset, she didn’t answer him. Max told her what he used to do. He also mentioned that they took away his job because the company’s stocks that he used to work for are plummeting. After her scars were treated in the clinic. Max asked “Maybe we could do this again tomorrow, walk our dogs? It’s Sunday, I mean if you don’t have anything to do. Maybe...” Alex didn't let him finish, she  said sarcastically  “Sure, so I can keep an eye on Dodger you irresponsible owner.”
                </p>
                <br>
                <p class="text-justify">Two years have passed and their relationship has grown stronger. Weeks before Max asked Alexto to move into his apartment, and she did a few days later. Dodger and Samantha got along pretty well, they were both happy. Max and Alex never had any real issues, sometimes Max wondered that if this was all a dream then he wished to never wake-up. Max still can't find a job though, but Alex didn't mind that, she supports Max and persuades him to follow his passion in animation.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="text-justify">On a winter midnight, a phone call woke Max and Alex up from their sleep. Max stood-up and answered the call. His jaw dropped, his throat cleared, his eyes staring into the void as he heard those words from the other end. He paused for a moment and he didn't know what to say. </p>
                <br>
                <p class="text-justify">He began by thanking the guy on the phone so much, and Alex  got a little excited and curious, she smiled and asked him who it was. Max replied that it was Danny from the Disney Pictures. They saw his portfolio and they invited him for an interview tomorrow morning. They both jumped in joy, screaming from the top of their lungs, celebrating. But it was very late, their dogs barked, as if like they’re annoyed that their sleep was disrupted, so Max and Alex went back to bed. Max cuddled Alex while on the bed so tight as if it was the last time. Alex said "Now you almost got your life back together love." Max overflowing with joy, failed to process what Alex meant by that. Alex was staring at him, proudly smiling. Max just closed his eyes and kissed her until he fell asleep.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="text-justify">On the next day Max woke up at 8 in the morning but Alex wasn't on the bed nor the bathroom. He figured that she might be on her way to her work already and because it was already late, too. But he felt sad because she didn't kiss him goodbye. Max took a bath and dressed up for the incoming interview later and took a heavy breakfast. Funny that Dodger and Samantha were nowhere to be found inside the apartment. He thought that maybe Alex already entrusted both of them to their neighbor since no one would be left in the apartment to take care of them. Max exited his apartment and went to the parking lot. Max ignites his car engine and maneuvers out of the parking space.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="text-justify">He hasn't driven on weekdays in a rush hour for two years. He forgot how congested the traffic was going to work. He knew he should have left the apartment earlier. He glanced over his watch and noticed that there was only half an hour left before his interview started. The Disney Pictures' office was an hour away from his current location. Max stepped on the gas, and drove recklessly going on a 90 on a two lane road. As he was approaching the intersection he already saw that the stoplight was on yellow, but he thought that he would still make it across. So Max went on fifth gear and stepped on it even more. Max failed to see an SUV intersecting the road and that the light had turned red. The SUV T-boned his car and sent it rolling for a few meters. He lost consciousness and he could just hear sirens in the distance. </p>
                <br>
                <p class="text-justify">Unaware of the time, he woke up on a hospital bed. The nurse taking care of him saw his eyes twitched so she ran outside his room and called the doctor. The doctor came into the room and asked how he was feeling. Max asked what happened, and the doctor explained. The doctor had a distressed look on his face and Max noticed it. Max asked if something bad happened to his internals. The doctor said that nothing bad really happened to him, the belt-buckle and the airbag from his car saved him from taking any serious injuries. "But while you were asleep we ran a CT scan. And we noticed there was already an anomaly in your brain even before the accident. It seems that you have an Acoustic Neuroma, a type of brain tumor that is hard to diagnose early on. But let's not panic, we're not entirely sure if it is that exactly, so maybe you could help us". Max swallowed and replied "how can I help exactly?". The doctor asked if he was experiencing any hallucinations or any psychotic manifestations. "Absolutely not! No." Max replied. "While in your sleep we heard you say the name Alex" the doctor said "who is she to you?" he asked. "She's my fiancé." Max said. "Can you call her right now and tell her I'm alright?" the doctor gave Max's phone to him and nodded. Max opened his phone and quickly went through contacts. He could not find the name Alex nor any call signs they were using. "Did my phone resetted due to the crash?" Max shouted. "It seems that it didn’t, because the wallpaper is not the default, and we didn't do anything to it Max'' the Doctor replied calmly. "Why can't I find her cell number here!".</p>
                <br>
                <p class="text-justify">"What does this Alex look like Max?" the Doctor asked. Max seemed bewitched that he can hardly remember what his fiancé looked like. He pulled up his phone again and opened the gallery hoping to see her fiancé's face. All it has is a photo of a dog from two years ago. Suddenly, unaware, tears started falling from Max's eyes while he stared at the picture of this dog. He immediately requested to be checked out of the Hospital and never spoke a word. The doctor advised him though, that he should come back and take another MRI. Max disregarded everything the doctor said and was left staring into the void. </p>
                <br>
                <p class="text-justify">He took a bus back to his apartment and everything seemed to clear up as seconds passed by. He opened his apartment door and saw a picture of a dog and a dog tag with the name "Dodger" on the coffee table. He sat on the couch and he grabbed the dog tag and he held it firmly, then he lifted the picture of the dog and pulled it close to him. His face covering up in tears as he looked at the picture. He wanted to scream but it felt like he had no voice. He remembers everything now. He knew he had been lying to himself. He couldn't bear the truth. He refused to accept what happened so his mind saved him from despair and misery. That day that the accident didn't happen two years ago, did happen. And there was no one there that saved Dodger from his fate.
